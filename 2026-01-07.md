## memory_storage_redesign (11:18:09)
<!-- tags: ['architecture', 'redesign', 'storage'] -->
Memory Storage Redesign Discussion:
1. Decision: Switch from topic-based filenames to daily log files (YYYY-MM-DD.md).
2. Rationale: Daily logs serve as high-fidelity 'Raw Data' for ingestion. Topics and sessions can overlap and are hard to pre-define. 
3. Future Vision: A centralized 'Brain Server' with LLM capabilities will perform background 'digestion' (summarization/compaction) to create structured knowledge from these daily raw logs.
4. Implementation: Modified src/store.py to append entries with '## topic (timestamp)' headers into daily files.
