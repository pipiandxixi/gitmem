GitMem Vision and Principles:
Vision: A semantic memory service using Git as a backend, providing persistent and traceable memory for AI Agents via MCP.
Principles:
1. Git-based: Records evolution of memories.
2. Markdown storage: Human and AI readable.
3. Metadata-driven: Uses YAML Front Matter for tags and dependencies.
4. Intent-based interaction: Hides physical file paths.
